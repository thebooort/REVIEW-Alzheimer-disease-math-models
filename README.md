## Perspectives on mathematical modelling for Alhzeimer's disease
![AD graphic representation](https://github.com/thebooort/REVIEW-Alzheimer-disease-math-models/blob/master/Memoria/trabajo/imagen.jpg)
 This work is a brief revision and study about some research articles related to Alhzeimer's disease (AD) published in last years. 
 My aim is to present its mains results, some technical highlights related to the mathematical way of modelling the disease, and comment about its implications and future research. 
 Althought this work is merely a revision it could be useful as a source of interesting models in cell dynamics and at a biomoleculal size dynamics due to the complexity of AD.

 Feel free to ask me about anything there.

 I made this review for my masters course about **Tumoral and Cellular Dynamics. **
